Things one needs to do to run this project locally.
 
1) open terminal in VS CODE and navigate to "server" directory(cd server)
2) Run command "node server.js" to start the server
3) open a new terminal and navigate to "client" directory(cd client)
4) Run command "npm run dev" to run client server
 
 
You will need a MongoDb database URI(MONGODB_URI) and "SENDINBLUE_API_KEY" which you can feed in the .env file. If you want me to share the one I have used for development then I will share it with you.
